# Perfume-Tester-Robot-Based-on-Raspberry-Pi
Its a Perfume Tester Robot I made for Jean Paul International and installed at Dolmen Mall Clifton Karachi.
I have used PIR MOTION Sensors to sense surrounding audiences so the system greets and instructs audience to stand in front of the robot, I have used weight sensor to sense someone standing on the deck than the robot lifts its left arm to spray the perfume.

I have used Python & Bash Scripting in Raspberry Pi for main controlling and display, and 16 channels Servo Driver I2C Interface for arms & shoulders controlling and weight sensor with 200 KG load cell for weight sensing. I have used 6 different servo motors to move shoulders and lift arms from 0 to 180 degrees.
