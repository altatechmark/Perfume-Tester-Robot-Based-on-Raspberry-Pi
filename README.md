Project Overview: The Jean Paul International Perfume Tester Robot

Location: Installed at Dolmen Mall Clifton, Karachi.

Introduction: This novel Perfume Tester Robot, designed and implemented specifically for Jean Paul International, revolutionizes the way customers experience fragrances. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, it provides an interactive and engaging way for patrons to sample perfumes.

Core Functionality:

Audience Interaction: PIR MOTION Sensors detect surrounding visitors, allowing the system to greet them and guide them to stand in the proper location in front of the robot.

Perfume Dispensing Mechanism: Upon detecting a person standing on the deck through a weight sensor, the robot's left arm lifts, initiating a graceful spray of the chosen perfume.

Movement Control: A combination of six distinct servo motors controls the shoulder movement and arm lifting from 0 to 180 degrees, contributing to the fluid and natural motion of the robot.

Technical Specifications:

Control and Display: Utilized Python & Bash Scripting within a Raspberry Pi framework for the main controlling and display interface.

Arm & Shoulder Control: Implemented 16 channels Servo Driver I2C Interface for precise manipulation of the robot's arms and shoulders.

Weight Sensing: Integrated a weight sensor with a 200 KG load cell to accurately detect when someone is standing on the deck.
